TODOS:

- Error handling in exam modal (Show errors and such)
- Clean code
- Create a way to change course and exam information on the front-end (React Router?)

IDEAS:

- Create course cards that will be listed beneath exams

INSTALLATION:

- Create secret.env file in the ./server/util/
  - Create MONGO_URI variable ("mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster0.x6hishj.mongodb.net/CO?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
    - If you want to use mock data, you don't need to set this
  - Create PORT variable
    - If not set, will default to 5000
  - Create NODE_ENV ("dev" || "prod")
    - NODE_ENV = "prod" doesn't do anything as of now
    - Do not create NODE_ENV variable, if you want to use mock data (list of plain Javascript objects; no MongoDB)

ISSUES:

- CourseModal won't let the mutation happen on the first click, but the second will go through?
  - It's inconsistent, when it goes through
  - Has something to do with the course_credit
    - FIXED!
- ExamModal doesn't change the courseId (It's always the first in the list)
  - Need to fix how it sets the courseId state
